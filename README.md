# TRA VFD API Documentation

This is an attempt to re-write the official TRA VFD's API in a developer friendly way.

The current documentation is written in PDF which makes it difficult to work on and hard to browse through the documentation. 

This is an attempt to make it easier for developers to work on this new & exciting API.

A lot of effort was spent to make this as accurate as possible, However, If there is any error/confusion please refer to the original documents.



## Contributions

This documentation is created using `mkdocs` therefore in order run it locally you need to have python, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and ofcourse [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) installed
